# Week 05 Tutorial — View-Routes-12327823

## 1. Project Overview
Created the **View-Routes-12327823** project.

## 2. Topology
Topology consists of 2 Linux Hosts connected via a Linux Router and a switch: **Host — Router — Switch — Host**.

## 3. Starting the Nodes
Started all nodes in the topology.

## 4. Routing Configuration
Reviewed the routing table on each device.

## 5. Network Connectivity Test (Ping)
Verified end-to-end connectivity using ping.

## 6. Dynamic Routing with OSPF

Imported the OSPF project and started all nodes.

Used the three FRR `show ip` commands to inspect routing information.

### Traceroute
Ran a traceroute to confirm the path taken across the OSPF-routed network.

## Reflection
This week's tutorial helped me develop a better understanding of routing and how devices communicate across different networks. I created the View-Routes-12327823 project and worked with a topology containing two Linux hosts, a Linux router and a switch. Starting the nodes and reviewing the routing tables helped me understand how routing information is used to determine where network traffic should be sent.
